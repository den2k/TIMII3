 TODO: 8.5.18 [DONE] - need to dismiss to Main screen and not just LoginScreen : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3224328/how-to-dismiss-2-modal-view-controllers-in-succession/44583711#44583711
 TODO: 8.6.18 [DONE 8.7.18] - Added user info to Firebase - uid, email, fullName, password
 TODO: 8.7.18: Refactor keyboard specific items to separate file
 TODO: 8.7.18 [DONE 8.7.18] - Refactor UUID in createUser as its not best practice and long -> Using Firebase currentUser ID
 TODO: 8.7.18 [DONE 8.7.18] - Add 1 to Firebase Member Countable once member is added successfully
 TODO: 8.7.18: Add Verify Password matches error handler
 TODO: 8.16.18: Refactor FB code and move Auth portion to new AuthenticationSystem and use Firestore in DatabaseSystem to store Members info.
 TODO: 10.10.18 [DONE 10.10.18] - Migrated code from TIMII to TIMII3
 TODO: 10.21.18 [DONE 10.21.18] - Use Firestoreable FSSave to save Member information within the Member Collection
 TODO: 10.10.18 - Redo Counting in FS. Need to implement Firestoreable / addUserComponentCountableDict so it saves Firestore and not Firebase. This is so counting of added Members works again.

                 information. There is probably a bunch of security/hacking related issues that are involved
